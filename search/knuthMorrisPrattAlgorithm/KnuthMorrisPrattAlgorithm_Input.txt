C was invented and first implemented by Dennis Ritchie on a DEC PDP-11 that used the Unix operating system. C is the result of a development process that started with an older language called BCPL. BCPL was developed by Martin Richards, and it influenced a language called B, which was invented by Ken Thompson. B led to the development of C in the 1970s.
